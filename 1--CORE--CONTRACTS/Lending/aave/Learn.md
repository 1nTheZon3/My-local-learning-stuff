##

- `reservesList` 
- active reserve addresses
- Iteration through all reserves for health factor calculations

- `eModeCategories`
-  Higher LTV ratios when collateral and borrow assets are in same category
-  Each has specific LTV, liquidation threshold, and bonus parameters

- `userConfig` 
- Bitmap tracking user's supplied/borrowed assets and collateral usage

- ***params** 

- `asset`: Address of the asset to borrow
- `user`: Transaction initiator (msg.sender)
- `onBehalfOf`: Account that will receive the debt (can differ from user)
- `amount`: Amount to borrow (in asset's native decimals)
- `interestRateMode`: 1 = Stable, 2 = Variable rate
- `referralCode`: Used for tracking/incentives (optional)
- `releaseUnderlying`: Whether to transfer tokens to user (true for normal borrow)
- `maxStableRateBorrowSizePercent`: Maximum stable borrow as % of total liquidity
- `reservesCount`: Total number of active reserves
- `oracle`: Price oracle contract address
- `userEModeCategory`: User's current eMode category
- `priceOracleSentinel`: Emergency circuit breaker for oracle prices

**cache**

`reserveConfiguration`: Borrow caps, LTV, liquidation parameters
`aTokenAddress`, `stableDebtTokenAddress`, `variableDebtTokenAddress`

Key Folders & Components to Focus On (Besides /src)
1. Test Folder Structure
The test folder is crucial for understanding:

Unit tests for individual components
Integration tests for complex interactions
Edge cases and failure scenarios
Gas optimization tests
Security-focused test scenarios

2. Critical Logic Libraries to Master
From the project knowledge, focus on these core logic libraries:
SupplyLogic.sol

executeSupply() - Core deposit functionality
Interest rate calculations and reserve state updates
Collateral enabling/disabling logic
Balance and configuration updates

BorrowLogic.sol

Variable vs stable rate borrowing
executeSwapBorrowRateMode() - Rate switching mechanism
executeRebalanceStableBorrowRate() - Rate rebalancing

LiquidationLogic.sol

executeLiquidationCall() - Critical for security audits
Health factor calculations
Liquidation thresholds and close factors
Collateral seizure mechanisms

ValidationLogic.sol

Health factor validation
LTV (Loan-to-Value) checks
E-mode category validations
Transfer and reserve operation validations

3. Key Testing Areas for Auditing
When reviewing tests, focus on:
Core Protocol Functions:

Supply/withdraw operations
Borrow/repay mechanisms
Interest rate model behavior
Liquidation scenarios
Flash loan implementations

Security-Critical Areas:

Health factor edge cases
Oracle price manipulation scenarios
Re-entrancy attack vectors
Access control validations
Emergency pause mechanisms

Mathematical Calculations:

Interest rate compounding
WadRayMath precision
PercentageMath calculations
Price oracle integrations

4. Essential Components for Deep Understanding
Pool.sol - Main entry point

All user-facing functions delegate to logic libraries
Modular architecture for upgradability

PoolConfigurator.sol - Administrative functions

Reserve configuration management
Risk parameter updates
Emergency controls

AaveOracle.sol - Price feeds

Chainlink integration
Fallback oracle mechanisms
Price validation logic

AToken.sol - Interest-bearing tokens

Scaled balance calculations
Transfer restrictions
Incentive distributions

5. Recommended Testing Strategy

Start with unit tests for individual logic libraries
Progress to integration tests for cross-component interactions
Focus on edge cases around liquidations and health factors
Study gas optimization tests to understand efficiency concerns
Examine upgrade and migration tests for proxy patterns

6. Key Areas for Audit Preparation

Oracle manipulation resistance
Flash loan attack vectors
Liquidation front-running scenarios
Interest rate model edge cases
Access control bypass attempts
Arithmetic overflow/underflow protections
Re-entrancy vulnerabilities

The modular architecture means most business logic is in the libraries (SupplyLogic, BorrowLogic, etc.), while the Pool contract acts as a facade. Understanding the test coverage for these libraries will give you deep insights into potential vulnerabilities and expected behaviors during auditing.
