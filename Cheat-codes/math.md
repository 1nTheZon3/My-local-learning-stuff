## üìê Collateral & Borrowing
| Formula / Concept                          | What it means                                     |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Collateral Value = deposits * price        | How much the collateral is worth in USD/ETH terms |
| Borrow Power = Collateral Value * LTV      | Max borrowable amount                             |
| Health Factor = (Collateral * LTV) / Debt  | Safety ratio; <1 ‚Üí liquidation                   |
| Liquidation Threshold                      | Ratio where liquidation can happen                |

- Check if price uses a manipulable oracle.
- Verify math is scaled correctly (decimals, 1e18 vs 1e6).
- Ensure health factor cannot be bypassed.

## üìâ Interest & Debt
| Formula / Concept                            | What it means                                     |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Interest Accrued = `debt * rate * time`      | How much extra borrower owes                      |
| Utilization = `borrows / (cash + borrows)`   | Borrowed % of pool                                |
| Rate Model = `baseRate + slope*utilization`  | Dynamic interest calculation                      |
| `Debt Index / Borrow Index`                  | Scaling factor for accrued interest               |

- Check if time units (seconds vs blocks) are consistent.
- Look for rounding errors in interest accrual.
- Ensure debt index always updates before user actions.

## üí∏ Rewards / Shares
| Formula / Concept                             | What it means                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Shares = deposit * (totalShares / totalAssets)| User‚Äôs ownership of pool                          |
| Assets = shares * (totalAssets / totalShares) | Convert back to real assets                       |
| Rewards per Share = rewards / totalShares     | Distribution formula                              |
| Accrued Rewards = userShares * rewardsPerShare| What user earns                                   |

- Check division order ‚Üí must avoid rounding away user funds.
- Ensure shares/asset conversion is consistent both ways.
- Watch for dust tokens (leftover due to rounding).
 
## üõë Math Attack Scenarios

| Mispriced Collateral                       | Oracle returns 0 or fake high price               |
| Infinite Mint                              | Bug in shares formula lets attacker mint extra    |
| Skewed Utilization                         | Flashloan inflates utilization ‚Üí rate manipulation|

## üïµÔ∏è Auditor Math Checklist    
| Check                                      | Why it matters                                    |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Is LTV correctly applied?                  | Wrong LTV ‚Üí over-borrow possible                  |
| Does Health Factor < 1 trigger liquidation?| Safety mechanism must work reliably               |
| Are decimals consistent?                   | Tokens use 6, 8, 18 decimals                      |
| Are interest & indexes updated timely?     | Delayed update = accounting drift                 |
| Are rewards capped or bounded?             | Prevents infinite reward bug                      |
| Is division done last (after multiply)?    | Prevents precision loss                           |
