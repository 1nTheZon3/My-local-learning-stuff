## üìù Auditor Checklist (Funds)
| Question / Check                             | Why it matters                                    |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Where do funds `enter`?                      | Entry points must be validated/sanitized          |
| Where do funds `leave`?                      | Exit points must enforce permissions              |
| Who can `move` funds?                        | Role-based access (admin, owner, etc.)            |
| Can funds get `stuck`?                       | Check for no-withdraw scenarios                   |
| Can funds be `drained`?                      | Look at loops, reentrancy, external calls         |
| Is `accounting` consistent?                  | `totalSupply` matches sum of balances?            |
| Are `fees` transparent?                      | No hidden tax/stealth transfer logic              |
| What happens on `upgrade/selfdestruct`?      | Proxy or destruct draining risks                  |

## üîÑ Moneyflow Tracing Workflow
| Step                                       | What to do                                        |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Identify entry points                   | Look for `deposit`, `payable`, `stake`            |
| 2. Trace storage                           | Where are balances stored? (`mapping`, `reserves`)|
| 3. Follow updates                          | Who updates them? (`_mint`, `_burn`, `shares`)    |
| 4. Identify exit points                    | Where funds can leave (`withdraw`, `transfer`)    |
| 5. Check permissions                       | Who is allowed to call those exits?               |
| 6. Look for external calls                 | Any `call`, `delegatecall`, `send`? Risks here    |
| 7. Verify accounting                       | Does `totalSupply` match balances?                |
| 8. Stress test scenarios                   | What if attacker calls multiple times / reenters? |
